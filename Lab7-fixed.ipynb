    "- In reality, though, Qiskit also considers the qubit order to be swapped (little endian), where the top qubit is the least significant (right-most) bit. That is for qubits from top to bottom q0, q1, q2, the bitstring is q2, q1, q0. So the state vector is still \\[00, 01, 10, 11\\] from this perspective. We can see this in the CX gate.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Setting up the Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simulate a quantum circuit with the following lines of code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from qiskit.providers.aer import QasmSimulator  \n",
    "  \n",
    "simulator = QasmSimulator()\n",
    "executed_job = qiskit.execute(circuit, simulator, shots=1024)\n",

The documentation for the execute function can be found here, which can be used to run simulators (or actual devices) on quantum circuits. It's also possible to specify the number of trials (the number of shots) to run. The execute function returns a Job object.\n",
    "\n",

    "The job object has a result() function that gives you the results of the simulator.\n",

    "executed_job.result()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This returns a result object. See the documentation here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to extract the counts from a given experiment. The circuit needs to record a measurement outcome at the end of each trial, so when you create your circuit, you must add a measurement at the end to record the outcome in a classical register. A simple way of doing this can be done with the QuantumCircuit.measure_all() function which creates the classical register for you. Alternatively, you can add the classical register yourself and use the QuantumCircuit.measure() function. See the Qiskit documentation for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a dictionary of results from the result object using get_counts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "r = executed_job.result()\n",
    "counts = r.get_counts(circuit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If printed out, the results dictionary will look like: \n",
    "{\"bitstring1\": count_1, \"bitstring2\": count_2, ... , \"bitstringn\": count_n}. \n",
    "The bitstrings in the dictionary represent the possible measurement outcomes of the quantum circuit.\n",

    "# Other Notes\n",

    "- You can use the plot_histogram(counts) function (see documentation **[here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram.html)) to visualize the results of a simulation once you have extracted the counts from the result object.\n",

    "c1: ----\n",

    "\n",
    "A Bell state is a maximally-entangled two-qubit state that produces correlations in the measurement outcomes. You can see these correlations in the results dictionary produced by the simulator in Qiskit.\n",

    "# Some Quick Notes on Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This section assumes you have general knowledge of programming concepts. It is merely here to introduce Python syntax you may be unfamiliar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a for loop over a sequence of numbers, k to n, use for i in range(k, n+1), with i being the item in the sequence for that iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely need to iterate over a dictionary. To do this, you can use a for loop to iterate over the keys to get the value. Use for key in dictionary: to get the keys, and use dictionary\\[key\\] to get the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## String\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also likely need to work with string literals. To get a specific character in a Python string, use string\\[i\\]. This gives the ith character of the string. Python indices start from 0. You can iterate over the characters of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more trick with strings to get a range of characters. For example, to get characters 2 to 4, use the following syntax: string\\[2:5\\]. We use string\\[start:end\\] to get the characters starting at start and ending at end-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the length of any item that supports it by using len(datastructure)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to for loops, you will need conditionals. This is a statement that performs the code inside of an indented block only if a certain given condition is met. These are of the form:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "  action to perform\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there is an alternative action you want to perform only if condition was not met, you can use an else statement underneath.\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "  action to perform\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  action to perform if the condition was not true\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are a basic primer of Python syntax that you will likely need. W3 Schools has excellent demos/tutorials for showing off Python's features and how to use them. Additionally, many of these techniques can be found in the linked notebook.\n",

    "# Exercise 2: Find the Entangled Qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be given a 6-qubit circuit and you will write a function that finds the two qubits that are entangled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit creates a pair of entangled qubits, then moves or separates those entangled qubits through a set of swap gates from their original position in a 6-qubit system. We will make the simplifying assumption that when the qubits became entangled, they started in the |0> states, meaning they are guaranteed to be in the \"same entangle\" state |Φ+>. How could one figure out which of these 6 qubits will be entangled? Using the simulation and analyzing the results! While 4 of the qubits will be in a 50/50 superposition resulting in random results, two of the qubits will be entangled and have correlated outputs to each other.\n",

    "You are responsible for creating the function that determines which two qubits are in the \"same entangle\" state. It takes the circuit, and, using your knowledge of the properties of entanglement, returns the pair of qubit indices (based on their location in the bitstring) that are entangled.\n",

    "# Exercise 3: Different EPR Pairs\n",
    "This exercise is identical to Exercise 2 except for one major difference: the two entangled qubits are not necessarily in the \"same entangle\" state. We know that they were not in superposition when they became entangled, but we do not know which of the states |00>, |01>, |10>, or |11> they were in when they became entangled.\n",

    "The goal is to find the two qubits that are entangled in a 6-qubit circuit. In order to do this, you are going to write two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, write a function that will convert the original |00> input to the desired |xy> output. The output of this function will then become the input to the previous problem's circuit that entangles two qubits and then moves them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using gates to adjust the starting state of the circuit, fill in the function prime_circuit that \"primes\" the entangled qubits to the given state based on a bitstring of 0s and 1s. (You can assume that bitstring will not be longer than qubit_list, the quantum register for the circuit.) That is, all of the qubits in the circuit start in the state |0>, and if there is a \"1\" in the corresponding bitstring, that qubit should be changed to be in the |1> state. The first character in the bitstring corresponds with the first qubit in the circuit, and the rest of the qubits follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function you need to adjust is the function that finds the entangled pair. Now you cannot assume the outputs of those two bits will always be the same as you did above, merely that they will always have a relationship corresponding with how entanglement correlates entangled outputs based on one of the above pre-entanglement starting states (|00>, |01>, |10>, or |11>). So think about what the possible relationships are (there aren't many) and search for all of those relationships in the outputs. Just like last time, all of the qubits in the circuit are in a 50/50 superposition state, so you have to look at the relationships between different pairs of outputs, not just the values of the outputs.\n",
